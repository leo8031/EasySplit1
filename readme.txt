**Our purpose:**  
* This program enables users to perform simple grouping of employees within an existing organization to facilitate staggered work shifts during the pandemic.

**User Manual:**  
* For instructions on how to use the program, please refer to the `readme.txt` file inside the compressed archive.  
* To use the version with a user interface, please download `Grouping App (GUI version)_v0.2.7z`.  
  **Note:** Welcome to use this new version; you no longer need to manually input the path, and it will automatically generate the `grouping_result.csv` file in the user-specified folder.  
* To use the version without a user interface, please download `Grouping App (no GUI version)_v0.4.7z`.
